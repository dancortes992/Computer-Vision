# Computer-Vision
### Background

This project is part of the Tripleten data science practium. Focuses of the project is copmuter vision image processing.

## Project Description

This project is taked with development of a model for age prediction to be used by the "GoodSeed supermarket", in order to verify age in alcohol purchases.

## Data

Features available in our data consist of:


**Train data split ratio:** 3:1:1

**Models evaluated:** DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, LogisticRegression

## Findings

Results on both validation and test sets demonstrate both decision tree and random forest algorithms to produce the highest accuracy score, thus being more likely to effectively classify client data into a service plan to recomend.

| Model | Accuracy|
| --- | --- |
| Decision Tree | 0.78 |
| Random Forest | 0.78 |

## Software

**Tools:** _python_, _jupyter_

**Libraries:** _pandas_, _sklearn_
